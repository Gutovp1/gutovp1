### Augusto Ventura Paiva

Guto is my nickname. I'm from Brazil and a passionate software developer. I enjoy learning languages, not only spoken but also programming languages such as Javascript, Typescript, and Python. I also like to learn and explore libraries such as React and frameworks like Next, Express, and Fastapi.
If you are interested in talking about web development send me a message here.
